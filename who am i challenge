-> first it gives me a log in page , 
I tried to enter any email and pass but it gives me wrong answer 

I decided to check the source code of the page -->> i found a comment has email Guest and pass Guest .
I checked it and entered me to another page welcome guest but i don't have admin privilege to know the flag .

so i checked the cookies and found that there is a base64 encode of the guest value stored in the cookie .
i decode it and change the value from Login=Guest to Login=admin,
and encode it again to put it in the cookie value -->> it success and it gives me the flag 

the flag is <FLag{B@D_4uTh1Nt1C4Ti0n}>
